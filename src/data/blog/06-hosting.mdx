## Hosting a Static Website on GitHub Pages

### Question: How to host a index.html in github pages

1. Push your code to a GitHub repo.
2. In Settings → Pages → Source: set to `/ (root)` or `main`.

**Tips:**

- Your index.html must be in root of the repo or `docs/` folder.

### Question: How to configure a custom domain (CNAME) for GitHub Pages

1. In your GitHub repo, create a file named `CNAME` in the root (or in the `public/` folder if using Astro).
2. Add your custom domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) as the only line in the `CNAME` file.
3. Push this file to your repository.
4. In GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages** and set your custom domain.
5. Update your DNS provider to point your domain to GitHub Pages (usually with an `A` or `CNAME` record).

### Question: How to deploy with GitHub Actions (and why use it)

- Use the [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) GitHub Action to automate deployment.
- This action builds your site and pushes the output to the `gh-pages` branch automatically on every push.
- **Advantages:**
  - No manual deployment steps.
  - Ensures your site is always up-to-date with your code.
  - Supports custom domains and advanced workflows.

### Question: Astro vs Hugo for static sites

- **Astro:**
  - Modern, component-based, supports multiple frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.).
  - Ships zero JavaScript by default for fast performance.
  - Great for blogs, documentation, and marketing sites.
- **Hugo:**
  - Go-based, extremely fast builds, uses Markdown and Go templates.
  - Large theme ecosystem, great for content-heavy sites.
- **Why choose Astro?**
  - If you want to use modern JS/TS, component-based UI, and minimal client JS, Astro is a great choice.
  - Hugo is best for pure Markdown content and ultra-fast builds.

### Question: How to set up an Astro project for GitHub Pages

1. Install Astro:
   ```sh
   npm create astro@latest
   # or
   pnpm create astro@latest
   ```
2. Choose a template and follow the prompts.
3. In `astro.config.ts`, set the `base` option if your site is not at the root (e.g., `/your-repo-name/`).
4. Add a `CNAME` file in `public/` if using a custom domain.
5. Add a GitHub Actions workflow (see above) to automate deployment.
6. Push your code to GitHub and verify your site at your custom domain or GitHub Pages URL.
