## Objective

This guide walks you through creating **Mini-Shell**, a Unix-like shell in Rust, covering command execution, piping, I/O redirection, built-in commands, background processes, and signal handling.

## Step 1: Environment Setup

- Install Rust using `rustup`.
- Initialize the project with `cargo new mini-shell`.
- Include dependencies in `Cargo.toml`.

## Suggested File Structure

```
mini-shell/
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs
│   ├── parser.rs
│   ├── executor.rs
│   └── utils.rs
├── tests/
├── Cargo.toml
└── README.md
```

## Step 2: Implementing the Shell Loop

- Create a loop to display a prompt, read input, and handle the `exit` command.

## Step 3: Executing External Commands

- Parse input commands into arguments.
- Implement process creation using `fork()`.
- Execute commands with `execvp()` and wait for completion using `waitpid()`.

## Step 4: Built-in Commands (`cd`, `exit`)

- Handle `cd` using `chdir()`.
- Implement `exit` with process termination.

## Step 5: I/O Redirection (`<`, `>`)

- Parse and handle input/output redirection.
- Use `open()` and `dup2()` for file operations.

## Step 6: Command Piping (`|`)

- Implement pipelines using `pipe()`, `fork()`, and `dup2()`.
- Ensure correct redirection of input and output streams between commands.

## Step 7: Background Execution (`&`)

- Support commands running in the background by detecting trailing `&`.

## Step 8: Signal Handling

- Capture and handle signals such as Ctrl+C and Ctrl+D gracefully.

## Step 9: Testing and Automation

- Write shell scripts in the `tests/` directory to automate verification of shell behavior.
