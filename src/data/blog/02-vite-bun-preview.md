## Running Vite Preview

To run the Vite preview, you need to have Vite installed in your project. If you haven't installed Vite yet, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
npm install vite --save-dev
```

Once Vite is installed, you can add a script in your `package.json` to run the Vite preview. Add the following script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```

Now, you can run the Vite preview using the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will start the Vite preview server, and you should see output indicating that the server is running. You can then open your browser and navigate to the provided URL to see your Vite app in action.

## Using Bun for Background Processes

Bun is a modern JavaScript runtime that can be used for various background processes. To use Bun, you need to have it installed on your system. You can download and install Bun from the official Bun website.
